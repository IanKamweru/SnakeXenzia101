INTRODUCTION:
This is my first project in Java.
My program is an offset of the Snake Xenzia Rewind 97 Retro game.

HOW THE GAME WORKS:
At the start menu, the player chooses a food type by clicking on the corresponding box.
The player can move the snake around using the corresponding arrow keys or W-Up, S-Down, A-Left, D-right.
